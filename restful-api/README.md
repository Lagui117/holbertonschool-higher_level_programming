# RESTful API

This project explores RESTful API development, consumption, security, and documentation using Python.

## Learning Objectives

- **HTTP/HTTPS Basics**: Understanding web protocols and data transfer
- **API Consumption**: Using command-line tools (curl) and Python (requests)
- **API Development**: Building APIs with http.server and Flask
- **API Security**: Implementing authentication and authorization
- **API Documentation**: Using OpenAPI standards

## Concepts Covered

### REST Architecture
- Stateless communication
- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON data format

### API Components
- Client: Request initiator
- Web Server: Request handler
- API Server: Business logic
- Database: Data storage

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask framework
- requests library
- Flask-HTTPAuth
- Flask-JWT-Extended

## Installation

```bash
pip install Flask requests Flask-HTTPAuth Flask-JWT-Extended
```

## Project Structure

- **Task 0**: HTTP/HTTPS basics and concepts
- **Task 1**: API consumption with curl
- **Task 2**: API consumption with Python requests
