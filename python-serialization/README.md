# Python - Serialization

This project explores marshaling and serialization concepts in Python, focusing on transforming data between different formats for storage and transmission.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the differences and similarities between marshaling and serialization
- Implement serialization in practical programming tasks
- Work with different serialization formats (JSON, XML, Pickle, CSV)
- Understand how serialized data is used in applications
- Evaluate performance implications of different serialization formats

## Concepts Covered

- **Marshaling**: Transforming memory objects into a format for storage or network transmission
- **Serialization**: Converting data structures into a format that can be saved or transmitted
- **JSON Serialization**: Human-readable text format
- **Pickle**: Python-specific binary serialization
- **XML**: Structured markup language for data representation
- **CSV to JSON**: Converting between different data formats

## Tasks

### 0. Basic Serialization
Basic JSON serialization and deserialization of Python dictionaries.

### 1. Pickling Custom Classes
Using the pickle module to serialize and deserialize custom Python objects.

### 2. Converting CSV Data to JSON Format
Reading CSV data and converting it to JSON format.

### 3. Serializing and Deserializing with XML
Using XML as an alternative serialization format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library modules: json, pickle, csv, xml.etree.ElementTree
